## Overview
The goal of this project was to have a microcontroller use an 
oscilloscope's X-Y mode to display Lissajous figures. 
The first stretch goal was to have the oscilloscope display more 
geometric shapes. The second stretch goal was design anf fabricate a 
functioning PCB. The stretch goals were met.
## Components
